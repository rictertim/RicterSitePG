Display type|Type set larger than the body copy to attract attention.
Distributing rollers|Rollers, usually rubber coated, that convey the ink from the fountain onto the ink drum.
Dot gain|The enlargement of the dots that form the tonal range in printing.  It tends to compound in each step of platemaking (an advantage of direct to plate systems) and also on press from the ink spreading out from the exact image areas of the plate, and the ink soaking and spreading into the paper.  The effect seen from dot gain, is a general darkening of screened areas.

Flying paster|A web press feature to assist in roll changes.  It automatically splices the paper from a new roll onto the tail of the paper currently running through the press without having to stop the press.
Focal length|A photographic lens's focal length is the distance between the rear nodal point of the lens when focused to infinity and the film or sensor of the camera.  As an object moves closer to the camera, a longer distance is required between the rear nodal point and the imaging surface.  Lenses with a shorter focal length give a wider angle of view.
Folio|Folio originally referred to a style of book making where each sheet was folded only once, to make 4 pages.  Books made this way tended to be large, and so the word came to be used for all books that were about 15” in height.  In books without numbering, it can be used to refer to the leaf count of a book, with recto and verso used to refer to the front or back of the leaf.  It is also sometimes used to simply refer to the page number.

Fountain solution|A solution of chemicals used to keep the non-printing areas of the plate from accepting ink.  Also called dampening solution.
Four colour process|The standard method used to represent full colour in print.  It used the 3 subtractive primary colours (cyan, magenta and yellow) plus black (K).  This is the basis for the CMYK colour space and is known as process colour.  Inks of these colours are know as process inks.  Printing presses are manufactured to print colour in this way that have 4 press units in sequence, each one printing one of the three primaries or black consecutively.  Small dots are are printed of each colour and when viewed together at a normal viewing distance, the eye blends the colour from the differing dots to create the illusion of a wide selection of colours.
Gamma|An exponential transfer function that describes the relation between light intensity and signal or visa versa.  output = input  ^ gamma where ^ denotes exponentiation and gamma is the exponent of the power function. Essentially it is a measurement of relative brightness, a larger number will provide a darker image.  The standard setting for a computer monitor is 2.2, although Macs used to use 1.8 for better matching to printers.
Gear streaks|Parallel streaks that appear across a print corresponding to the gears on the cylinder.
Generation|Each time an analogue image is reproduced.  For example when light comes into a photographer's lens and records an scene, that is a first generation recording.  If that film or file was then sent to a lab and a print was made, the print would be second generation.  A scan of that print would be third generation, and so on.  With each generation, quality is lost.
Grain|In paper the grain is the direction most of the fibres in the paper lie.  This corresponds to the direction that the paper travelled through the paper machine when it was made.
Graining|Slight roughening of a surface using abrasives.  Graining applied to metal printing plates causes greater water retention and adhesion of coating to an otherwise smooth surface.

Hue|The property of colour that makes red differ from blue and green.  The other two properties of colour are lightness and saturation.  A shade of warm, soft pink may have the same hue as a particular red, the change of colour being caused by a change in lightness, however a bright magenta may have the same lightness as a red, the difference being a change in hue.
Hydrophilic|Water loving.  It is a surface that attracts water or easily becomes wet.
Hydrophobic|Water repelling.  It is a surface that repels water, such as a non-stick pan.
Image setter|A device that images film by exposing it to light.  The film is usually mounted around a drum and the imaging head operates inside the drum either spinning or oscillating.  Image setters have largely been replaced by plate setters that skip film altogether and go directly from computer to plate.

Insert|A separately printed piece placed into another printed piece.
IPS|An acronym for In-Plane Switching.  It is a technology that improves the colour reproduction and viewing angles of LCD panels making them suitable for graphics work.  The fundamental difference is that the electric charge travels across the pixels (or in the same plane) rather than through the liquid crystal from a back layer to a front layer.

JPEG|An acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group.  It is used to refer to a file compression standard created by the committee.  It is a lossy meaning some digital information is lost during compression and cannot be restored.  Colour information is reduced because the human eye is more sensitive to brightness (value) variations than colour variations.  The image is divided into 8x8 pixel blocks and each of these is compressed further using complex algorithms.  In highly compresses JPEG images the 8x8 blocks and blurry colour can be seen.  File extentions used for this file format are usually .jpg and .jpeg although .jpe, .jfif, and .jif are also used.  JPEG images are often imbedded in other file formats as well.
Kerning|Adjusting the spaces between letters so that they appear balanced.  This may require parts of one letter to hang into the area usually occupied by the adjacent character.  For example in WA, the rightmost point of the W might directly above the leftmost part of the A.
Keyline|A line, usually black that follows the edges of differently coloured areas, or image.  Before modern technology improved the printing process to allow for improved accuracy. it was commonly used to mask misregistration where it was more visually obvious around the edges of objects.
Keyplate|The plate of the colour used to register the others to.  Usually the plate with the most detail is chosen.
Kiss impression|The balance of pressure of the paper to the blanket.  Too much pressure and there will be a smudging effect, too little and the image is not completely transferred.

Some LCDs will allow light to pass when voltage is applied and some when voltage is not applied.  Colour is made by attaching red green and blue filters to minute sub-pixel sections or micro pixels of the LCD.
Leaders|Rows of dots, dashes or other markings that lead the eye across the page.  Typically seen in tabbed tables and charts, table of contents pages and forms.
Leading|The amount of space between lines of type.  The term comes from the pieces of lead that would be inserted between lines of type in traditional typesetting.
Ledger paper|A grade and size (11 x 17 inches) of writing paper designed for record keeping.  Also called tabloid paper because of it's size being similar to tabloid size newspapers.
Line art|Traditionally it was any artwork copy that did not require halftone screening.  In a computerized graphic art environment it refers to single bit per pixel images (each pixel can be either black or white.)  
Long ink|An ink that flows well on the ink rollers.  If an ink is too long, it breaks up into filaments and increases ink misting.

Matte finish|A paper surface finish with no inherent glossiness.
Mechanical pulp|Raw wood fiber that has had no further processing.
Megapixel|One million pixels.  Generally terminology used to describe digital cameras.  Incidentally more megapixels does not necessarily mean more quality.  There are a number of other factors that affect the quality of the system, the most significant being the quality of the lens in front of the sensor.  The electronics cannot record a better image than the optics can produce.  Also sensors with higher pixel density are more susceptible to noise and tend to have poorer low light performance.  Therefore it is not uncommon for a point and shoot camera with fewer megapixels to have the same recordable image resolution as a higher megapixel but otherwise similar camera, but for the lower megapixel camera to have better low light and cleaner performance.  Even professional and prosumer SLR digital cameras are reaching the point that the physical restrictions of the lens and light wavelengths limit resolution rather than the pixels in the sensor.  Extra megapixels also means larger files taking up space on your computer.

The number that is put on at once is the number up.  eg. 4-up, 6-up etc.  Sometimes this is also called the number out, 2-out 3-out and so on.
Negative|An image, usually on film, in which the values (and hues in a colour negative) are reversed making black appear white, red appear cyan etc.
Newsprint|A low cost paper made primarily of groundwood pulp with some chemical pulp added.  Sold on rolls for web printing.
Neutral density (ND) filter|A neutral gray optical filter.  This filter uniformly cuts down all colours of light entering a lens.  A typical photographic use would be to achieve slower shutter speeds at a given f-stop enabling artistic blur effects such as smooth flowing water.  Another would be to allow a wider aperture in bright light to allow for a shallower depth of field.
Nips|The line of contact between two rollers.  The pull or draw rollers on a web press are often called nips.
Offset|The process of transferring  an image via a secondary carrier.<br>1) the process in offset lithography where the image is transferred from the image on the plate to a rubber blanket and then from the blanket to the substrate.<br>2) a printing defect where ink that has not fully dried is transferred to it's neighbour, typically the next piece in the stack, or an adjacent page in web printing.
Offset paper|Paper that has been manufactured to impart properties suitable for offset printing.
Opacity|The ability of paper to transmit light through it's surface.   Low opacity paper will show the image on the other side of the sheet, or even the next page though it's surface.  An opaque paper will effectively block the image on it's reverse side.

Positive|Film with normal, true to life (not reversed as in a negative) colour and value renderings
Press proof|A copy of a piece that is actually printed on a press either at the start of a run or prior to it and is used as a contract proof.  A press proof is the most reliable way to ensure that the finished product matches the proof signed by the customer.
Primary colours|In printing subtractive primary colours are used, meaning that if you have an absence of all of the colours (of ink in this case) white (or paper colour) is seen.  In anything based on light to create colours, additive primary colours are used, when all the primary colours of light are added together white is produced.  The additive primary colour of light are red, green and blue.  The subtractive primary colours are cyan magenta and yellow.  Black is added in printing for practical reasons, and to add a darker shadow tone.

Runnability|The properties of paper that affect how readily it can be printed on.  The papers ability to consistently absorb and hold ink, it's structural stability and texture can all affect it's runnability.
Running head|Information that appears on the top of each page.
Saddle stitched|A piece bound with wire staples through the center fold.
SATA|A storage interface for attaching hard drives and optical drives to computers.  It replaces the older ATA interface which was parallel, lower speed and did not allow connecting and disconnecting while the machine was powered up.  SATA also has a much smaller and simpler cable of eight pins instead of forty for ATA.
Scaling|Adjusting the size that something is to be reproduced at.
Scan-a-web|A rotating mirror arrangement that allows the viewing of the printed paper as it travels through a web (roll fed) press.
Scanner|An electronic device that shines light at or through two dimensional objects and records the reflected or transmitted image using electronic sensors, usually a CCD.
Score|To indent or otherwise mark the paper to assist folding.
Screen angles|When traditional halftone dots are made they all line up in rows and columns.  Screen angles are the angle at which these dots lie compared to the paper.  In process printing  each colour is printed at a different angle to prevent the dots from interfering with each other and creating moire patterns.  A typical set of angles would be Cyan at 105&deg;, Magenta at 75&deg;, yellow at 0&deg; and black at 45&deg;.  With a good set of angles the dots when printed together should create a rosette pattern.
Screen printing|Printing performed by pressing ink through a masked silk screen.  The most common use is for printing on fabrics.
Scum|The presence of ink in the non-print areas of a print job.
Self cover|When the outside pages of a book are the same paper as the interior with no additional cover bound on top.
Serif|The small cap lines at the end of character formations in serif fonts such as Times.
Sharpen|(on press) to decrease ink flow on press.  Opposite of thicken which tends to make dots swell with the extra ink.
Sheetwise|To print on one side of the press sheet, and then print the second side with new plates.  Also called sheetwork.
Short ink|Buttery ink that drops like a blob of thick gravy.  Long ink on the other hand is more elastic and stringy like melted cheese or honey.
Show through|When image printed on one side can be seen through to the reverse side.
Side guides|Devices on the feed board to accurately position the sheets of paper as they enter a sheet-fed press.
Signature|A printed sheet that, after folding becomes a section of a book.
Sizing|A water resistant paper treatment.
Small caps|Text with lower case letters substituted for smaller capital letters, while capitals remain full size.
Software|Any computer code written to operate, or run on, a computer.  Compare hardware.
Stochastic dots|A random dot pattern that allows greater detail reproduction and smoother visual texture in printing.  When the technology was new, there were several disadvantages, but numerous advances have been made in overcoming these challenges and today hybrid and quasi random dot patterns overcome these obstacles to reap the advantages stochastic without causing problems on press.
Tooth|The surface texture of paper that assists in it's ability to accept ink.
Transparent ink|Ink that when printed with, will not completely obscure what is under it.
Trapping|Small over printed areas between differing ink colours to mask slight misregistration on press.  Without trapping even minute misalignment of the colours can cause slender white lines to appear between adjoining colours.
Trim marks|Small lines printed outside the page area of a piece to assist correct trimming.
Two-sidedness|A quality of paper with differing properties on each side.
Undercut|The difference in radius on a printing press cylinder between the bearers and cylinder body to allow space for the plate or blanket.
Unit|A multi colour press is like having several presses in one.  The section of the press that prints each colour is called a unit.
USB|A common desktop computer interface used to connect all kinds of peripheral devices from scanners to hard drives to keyboards.  The original USB had quite a slow transfer speed, however USB2 was a drastic improvement.
Varnish|A clear usually glossy finish applied to improve durability and appearance.
Vehicle|The part of the ink that provides the body and acts as a carrier for the pigment.
Vellum paper|Paper with a vellum finish has good absorbency and fast ink penetration.  The word vellum comes from a latin word that means from calf.  Vellum paper is made to mimic the smoothness and thickness of true animal skin vellum parchment.
Vignette|An effect applied to make an image gradually fade into the background with a feathered edge.
Walk off|When part of the image area of a plate starts to loose it's ability to hold ink.
Warm colour|Colours that are on the red-orange-yellow end of the spectrum.
Washup|Cleaning the ink off of a press with appropriate solvents.
Watermark|1) a pattern stamped into paper at manufacture.<br>2) a faded pattern or lettering bearing a copyright notice on images.
Web|The paper as it passes through a web press off of the roll.
Web press|A press that prints off of rolls of paper rather than sheets.
Widow|A single word on a line all by its self at the end of a paragraph.
Work and tumble|When one side of a press sheet is printed and then the stock is flipped over and fed back through the press, using the opposite edge of the stock for the gripper edge, but with the same set of plates.
Work and turn|When one side of a press sheet is printed and then the stock is flipped over and fed back through the press, using the same edge of the stock for the gripper edge and with the same set of plates.
Wove finish|A frequently used smooth even paper finish.
